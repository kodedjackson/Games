# Games

I have designed and code 3 games in this repository.



2. ADDIIONAL GAME:
The computer will generate two numbers for you to add together, you have 10 seconds to hit a new highscore

1. Subtraction:
The computer will generate a random number between 1 to 9 and you have to guess it before the time reaches 0!

3. Multiplication Game:
The computer will generate two numbers for you to multiply, you have 10 seconds to hit a new highscore


I am able to do this with the use of HTML/CSS and javascript,
one of the key things i learnt while building the game is how to use persitant data(aka, cookies). You will notice that even when you
refresh the pages, your high score remains the same, that way you don't miss out on any of it.
